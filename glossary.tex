	This is intended to be a list of basic definitions for common things in math. This will likely be updated as the year goes on, the most recent version will be at \url{MckinleyX.github.io/files/glossary.pdf}.

	If you think something should be added to the list, or I've made an error, contact me!

\section{Common symbols}
Here's a list of some of the more common symbols you'll see:
	\term{\forall}{for all} 
	\term{\exists}{there exists} 
	\term{\in}{is an element of}
	\term{\because}{because}
	\term{\therefore}{therefore}
	\term{\mathbb{Z}}{the set of all integers}
	\term{\mathbb{Z}^+}{the set of all positive integers}
	\term{\mathbb{Z}^*}{the set of all nonnegative integers}
	\term{\mathbb{R}}{the set of all real numbers}
	\term{a \mid b}{$a$ divides $b$}
	\term{\qed}{Used to denote the end of a proof. There are a \href{https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2019/10/02/how-to-end-a-proof/}{\emph{lot}} of ways to do this, but this is what I use.}
	\term{\implies}{implies. $p \implies q$ if $q$ is true whenever $p$ is true. (Note that if $p$ is false $q$ is not necessarily false.)}
\section{Less common symbols}
Here are some symbols that are less common:
	\term{\mathbb{Q}}{the set of all rational numbers}
	\term{\mathbb{C}}{the set of all complex numbers}
	\term{\binom{n}{r}}{$n$ choose $r$}
	\term{\iff}{if and only if, commonly abbreviated as ``iff''. $p \iff q$ means that both $p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$.}
